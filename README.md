# 2.O
I have started three B2B companies and every time, it was because I saw a problem and believed I could correct it. The problems faced customers who I believed would benefit from my/our solution. Thus the businesses were “other” directed — not created because I wanted to create a job for myself rather than being an employee.

That strong belief in the solution I wanted to offer enabled me to do the heavy lifting required in any start-up.

I’m no longer convinced that a start-up requires a love of xxx or xxx or even, passion. Instead, you must be such a believer in the solution that you are filled with the determination to make it happen. Absent that, when the honeymoon stage of a launch ends — that “oh wow, I am a business owner” fun time — you will not have the energy, the drive to do the long hours, days with no rest, skipping of unproductive social time and more to take it from birth to maturation.

Now, of course, there are such issues as market size, competition, cost to bring to market, resources, and more. A novel solution offered in a mature market dominated by gorillas with bags of jingle is going to be a tough ring to compete within. Sure you can do it. But do consider those gorillas. Do you have the moxie to try? It’s truly going to be a battle royale. And yes, business can most certainly be a competition, a contest.

What about costs involved in bringing the solution to market? I’ve had many sad experiences with innovators who simply could not bring their product to market because the market would not pay the price and the inventor was unwilling or unable to take the steps that might be available to lower the price or do the work to change minds re price.

Is the market large enough to support the business? That requires number crunching and an honest assessment of the size of the market you are selling into. If it’s not large enough to support the business, what can you do to increase the market size? This seems common sense but not long ago, a new business person asked for advice from me on their business, a convenience store located along a river where there was very little vehicle traffic and they were the solo entity for a good 30 miles. In fact, the traffic was so limited that it was lucky if they sold 6 cups of coffee daily. The only way they could survive is to innovate or move.

And then, of course, there is the question that everyone asks — How do I get the money? If you don’t have it, someone does. And if you truly believe in what you are doing, that belief will affect your entire being and result in others being persuaded to rally behind you. Best if those “others” have jingle if you do not.

So, in answer to your question, I usually am following a mission — a mission to change x, to solve this or that problem. Missions create determination within me. I couldn’t sleep while building that business even if I wanted to because the mission becomes a force that drives me. Hope this helps somewhat!
